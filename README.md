In this repository there are some tools for developing neural network models using Tensorflow applied to nanophotonics problems.  

In the _models_ folder you can find some examples of neural networks for predicting the electromagnetic response of a eliptical metal nanoparticle when it is reached by a plane monocromatic wave.  
The networks recieve some input parameters refering to the particle's geometry, the length of each one of its semi-axes and its angle of inclination, and they return as output the spectrum of its Cross section for a range of incident frequencies.
